# BitBox Framework

## Introduction

This project is made to create a custom personal framework, which I use in my projects.
Heavily inspired in the Bootstrap framework, it's totally Flex based(even the grid), and
it's free, feel free to fork/clone/modify/etc.

## Why create a Bootstrap related framework instead of only using Bootstrap?

I love Bootstrap but there are some things that I didn't liked it, so I made
more 'speakable', more alike to the English language, so the classes in the tags
looks more like phrases, for example:

```
  <div class='minibox border rounded bolder'>
    <span> Content </span>
  </div>
```

Another thing is that: I love Flex, so I tried to do as 'Flexier' as possible,
making more self-adjustable.
